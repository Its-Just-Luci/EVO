Sunflares by JadeOfMaar.
License: CC-BY-NC-ND.

Stock pack sunflares are only for use with G class main sequence stars (the stock Sun). Feel free to reconfigure and share for scaled systems. 
Derivatives (recolors) are not welcome as any variants to these for other classes of star already exist. I will soon release the larger packs (dev packs) for these, and will assist planet makers in making or integrating those packs themselves.

If you are a planet maker, feel free to ask about them in the thread for this.

Tested with Scatterer 0.0320b (for KSP 1.3) and Stock Visual Enhancements 1.2.5.

INSTALL NOTE:
* DELETE the Sunflares folder inside Stock Visual Enhancements if there is one*
